# Homework01_Code_Refactor

Our first homework assignment!

## The objective

The object of the assignment was to give the page more semantic meaning as well as making the website more accessibile to people with with disabilities, so they can access the website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.

## How I accomplished this
I went through the .html file and updated the div tags with tags that have semantic meaning as well as go through the .css file and consoldate the styles where I could.

### What the deployed site looks like
