# Homework01 Code Refactor

## The Objective (The What)

To ensure that Horiseon, a marketing agency, follows accessibility standards and that there code is optimized for search engines.

## The Motive (The Why)
To ensure that people with dissabilites can access Horiseon's site using assistive technologies and so that the website can be easily found on the internet. 

## The Solution (The How)
I went through the html file and updated the title and replaced most of the div tags with tags that have more semantic meaning (i.e. header, nav, main, section, aside and footer). I put notes in the html to help in indentifying the changes that I made. I also went through and consoldated some of the css so that it would not be so cluttered.
